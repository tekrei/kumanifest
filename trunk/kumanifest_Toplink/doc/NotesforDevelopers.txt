Notes for developers
--------------------

1. Kumanifst has been developed with jdk 6. So you have to change the "Compiler compliance level" to 6.0. From Project->Properties->Java Compiler-> chech the Enable project specific settings.

2. Replace "Persistence.create.xml" for the first time running of the kumanifest. This will create the kumanifest database. 

3.After the creation of database, just replace the persistence files back to previous case.
